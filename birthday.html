            Another Year <br><br>

            I'm wishing you another year<br>
            Of laughter, joy and fun,<br>
            Surprises, love and happiness,<br>
            And when your birthday's done,<br><br>

            I hope you feel deep in your heart,<br>
            As your birthdays come and go,<br>
            How very much you mean to me,<br>
            More than you can know.<br><br>
