Login instruction: You can use username "Zedong" to see the basic features. User name is case sensitive. You can also register one for your own username and try to upload/view/delete.

Creative Portion:
1. We added file size limit and file type limit. Certain types of files are not allowed to upload. Big files are not permitted either. 
2. We added a register feature that allow user to create their own account. This not only adds the user to the user list but also make a new directory with the user name in the server. It serves just like a normal user originally on the list. The user names can only allow letters and numbers. Others will show error message. Existed usernames cannot be recreated neither, you will be asked to create a unique one.
